# Lab 2: SQLite database and CRUD routes

> The live server stores its database in `/tmp`, which is the only writable folder on Vercel. Adding, updating or deleting a book through the live link works, but the data goes back to the 10 starting rows when the server restarts. The local version keeps its changes in `books.db`.

## Objective

Connect an Express server to a SQLite database and expose create, read, update and delete operations over HTTP, so the `book` table changes after POST, PUT and DELETE.

## Technologies used

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Express.js 4
- SQLite (`sqlite` and `sqlite3` packages)
- nodemon (development only)
- SQLite command-line shell
- Visual Studio Code

## How to run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed (`node --version`, `npm --version`)
- The SQLite CLI is only needed if you want to create the database by hand

### Install and start

Open a terminal in this `lab-02` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts the server with nodemon, so it restarts automatically on every change. The terminal prints:

```text
Server running on port 3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/books/` in the browser. Use `npm start` instead of `npm run dev` to run it with plain Node.

### Database

The database file `books.db` is committed, so the project works as soon as it is cloned. To rebuild it from scratch:

```bash
sqlite3 books.db < init.sql
```

or, without the SQLite CLI installed:

```bash
npm run seed
npm run seed -- --reset     # drops the table and re-inserts the 10 rows
```

To inspect the table:

```bash
sqlite3 books.db
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT * FROM book;
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | No | Port the server listens on. Falls back to `3000` when it is not set. |

No database password, API key or `.env` file is used in this lab, so there is nothing to keep secret. `.env` files are ignored by `.gitignore` in case they are added later.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description | Success |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/books/` | Returns every book in the table. | 200 |
| GET | `/books/:bookId/` | Returns the book with that id. | 200 |
| POST | `/books/` | Adds a book from the JSON body. | 201 |
| PUT | `/books/:bookId/` | Replaces the details of an existing book. | 200 |
| DELETE | `/books/:bookId/` | Deletes the book with that id. | 200 |

Request body for POST and PUT:

```json
{
  "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer",
  "author": "Andrew Hunt",
  "price": 500,
  "pages": 352
}
```

Error responses:

| Case | Status |
|---|---|
| `bookId` is not a positive whole number | 400 |
| A required field is missing or has the wrong type | 400 |
| The request body is not valid JSON | 400 |
| No book exists with that id | 404 |
| Unknown route | 404 |

Every query that uses input from the request uses `?` placeholders, for example:

```js
await db.get("SELECT * FROM book WHERE id = ?;", [bookId]);
```

## Testing

Every route was tested in Postman against the locally running server, and the result was compared with the SQLite CLI. The collection is included as `postman_collection.json`: import it into Postman and it contains all seven requests, with the `baseUrl` variable set to `http://localhost:3000`. The screenshots below show each request in Postman with its status code and response body, and the SQLite CLI screenshots show the table before and after the changes.

| Route | Status observed | Database effect |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /books/` | 200 | none |
| `GET /books/1/` | 200 | none |
| `POST /books/` | 201 | new row added, id 11 |
| `PUT /books/1/` | 200 | row 1 updated |
| `DELETE /books/10/` | 200 | row 10 removed |
| `GET /books/999/` | 404 | none |
| `GET /books/abc/` | 400 | none |

## Screenshots

### Database before testing

The `book` table and its 10 starting rows, read with the SQLite CLI.

### GET /books/ â€” all books

Returns every row with status 200.

![GET all books](./screenshots/get-all.png)

### GET /books/1/ â€” one book

Returns the single book with id 1 and status 200.

![GET one book](./screenshots/get-one.png)

### POST /books/ â€” add a book

Adds a book and returns status 201 with the new id.

![POST add a book](./screenshots/post.png)

### PUT /books/1/ â€” update a book

Updates the fields of book 1 and returns status 200.

![PUT update a book](./screenshots/put.png)

### DELETE /books/10/ â€” delete a book

Deletes book 10 and returns status 200.

![DELETE a book](./screenshots/delete.png)

### Error case â€” unknown book id

`GET /books/999/` returns 404 because no such row exists.

![Unknown book id](./screenshots/error-404.png)

### Error case â€” invalid book id

`GET /books/abc/` returns 400 because the id is not a positive whole number.

![Invalid book id](./screenshots/error-400.png)

### Database after testing

Row 1 is updated, row 10 is gone and the book added with POST has id 11.
